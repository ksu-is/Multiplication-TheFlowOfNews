1. Create empty python document and commit it to the repository. - DONE
2. Evaluate code base here: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Graphs. Determine starting place of software depending on the structure of source code.
3. Build a basic network according to the code base. The code doesn't have to have variables, but the GUI should be functional.
4. Incorporate "generations" into the network-- this is how many connections there are in a single stream.
5. Incorporate "faithfulness" into the network-- this is how many connections are split off, on average, from an individual spot.
6. Incorporate "reproducibility" into the network-- this impacts how the spot will be different from the preceding spot.
7. Test code with many different combinations of the variables.
8. Build proper code documentation according to the software thus far. 
9. Download file and test locally through IDLE
10. Submit project into final sprint submission on D2L
