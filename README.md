# Multiplication-TheFlowOfNews
The goal of this software is to map how news will flow through a population depending on certain variables.


Generation 0: This is the source of the news.

Generation 1: These are the firsthand recipients of the news.

Generation 2: These are the secondhand recipients of the news.

Generation X: These are the x-hand recipients of the news.

There are other variables that will impact the flow of news. 
How many “generations” are there? More generations lead to more impact. 
How “faithful” is a person to tell the news? More faithful people lead to more impact.
How “simple” or “reproducible” is the news? More reproducibility leads to more impact.
How “transformative” is the news? More transformation leads to more impact. 

I will fold all of these variables into the software. The most difficult part will be mapping the software. I found this repo that seems to be very useful for my specific project:
